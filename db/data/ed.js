    'Remove the turkey from the fridge at least 1 hr before cooking. Heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 9.

After the turkey has had 2 hrs in total, check its temperature with a probe thermometer.

If the temperature is lower, return the turkey to the oven for periods of 15 mins until the temperature is reached.
