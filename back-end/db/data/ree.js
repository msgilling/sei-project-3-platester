Make sure the dough is well dusted with flour to stop it sticking. Dust another baking sheet with flour then put a pizza base on top – spread 4-5 tbsp of the tomato sauce on top and add some sliced tomatoes and grated vegan cheese. Drizzle with a little olive oil and bake in the oven on top of your preheated baking tray for 10-12 mins or until the base is puffed up and the vegan cheese has melted and is bubbling and golden in patches.',

I kept it in for the required amount of time but when I took it out, they were completely flat, soft (even after 1hr+ of cooling) and tasted very bad. To be honest I think it is because of the aquafaba- in standard meringues there is something to combine it all together (the protein in the egg) but in this it is like trying to make cake with milk and butter. Do not bother trying this- it is a waste of time and energy. You are much better off buying vegan meringues from a supermarket. Hope this helped.',

It went down a treat with my vegan and omnivorous guests, and with me.',

      'For the filling, place the chickpeas and potatoes in separate large pans. Cover both with water and add 1/4 tsp asafoetida to the chickpea pan. Bring both to the boil. Cook the potatoes until softened and then drain. Once the chickpea pan is boiling, bring down to a simmer and cook for a further 10 mins. Drain both together and leave to cool.',

Heat your oil to 180C (if you don’t have a thermometer, simply take a tiny piece of bread and if it turns golden brown in seconds, your oil is ready). Carefully place the puris into the oil and when they begin to rise up to the surface, gently hold a ladle down on top of them. This helps the puris to puff up. When the puris are golden brown, remove with a slotted spoon and drain on absorbent kitchen paper.',
