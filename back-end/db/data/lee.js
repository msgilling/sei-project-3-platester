  method: [
    'To make the filling, heat the oil in a frying pan, add the onion and garlic, mix in the spices and fry for 10 mins until soft. Add the vegetables, seasoning and stir well until coated. Add the stock, cover and simmer for 30 mins until cooked. Leave to cool.',
    'To make the pastry, mix flour and salt into a bowl. Make a well in the centre, add the oil and 100ml water to make a firm dough. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-10 mins until smooth and roll into a ball. Cover in cling film and set aside at room temperature for 30 mins.',
    'Divide the pastry into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and roll out into a circle of 15cm. Divide this circle into two equal pieces with a knife.',
    'Brush each edge with a little water and form a cone shape around your fingers, sealing the dampened edge. Fill with 1 tbsp mixture and press the two dampened edges together to seal the top of the cone. Repeat with the remaining pastry.',
    'Heat the oil in a large deep saucepan to 180C. The oil should come 1/3rd of the way up the pan. Deep fry the samosas in batches for 8-10 mins until crisp and brown. Take out and drain on kitchen paper.'

  description: 'These Indian pastry parcels are freezable, so make a batch and keep some for a rainy day. Serve with cooling raita and crisp salad',
  ingredients: [
    '2 tsp olive oil , plus 100ml for brushing',
    '400g lean lamb mince',
    '4 tbsp tikka paste',
    '1 large onion , grated, excess juice squeezed out',
    '1 large carrot , peeled and grated',
    '4 tsp dried mint',
    '2 tbsp mango chutney , plus extra to serve',
    '200g frozen pea',
    '270g pack filo pastry sheets (6 sheets)',
    'leaf salad and raita , to serve'
  ],
  method: [
    'In a large, wide pan, heat 1 tsp oil. Season the lamb well and fry until browned all over. Add the tikka paste to the pan for another 2 mins until fragrant. Add the onion and carrot with the remaining 1 tsp oil, and fry for 5 mins until the veg has softened. Tip into a large bowl and mix with the mint, chutney and frozen peas. Leave to cool.',
    'Spread out a sheet of filo, with a short end towards you. Brush with oil all over. Fold each long edge into the centre by 5cm, so you have a long, narrow piece of filo. Add about 130g of mixture to the top left of the strip and fold the top right corner of filo over to make a triangle. Continue folding down the length of the pastry to make a samosa shape. Brush with more oil. Transfer to a baking tray lined with baking parchment, wrap in cling film and freeze. Use within 3 months.',
    'To cook from frozen, heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Cook the samosas on their baking tray in the middle of the oven for 35-40 mins, turning over halfway through cooking, until golden and piping hot in the middle. Drain on kitchen paper to absorb excess oil and serve with salad, the extra chutney and raita.'
